Welcome to Team 8thdays!!!

We are working together to create a website to display the top ten clubs in the premier league and other information such as Premier League Table. Users are able to see information about players, managerment of each teams.

We will also provide a page call "score: number of fans", which allow users see the most/least popular player in the league. Users can watch videos of Match highlights as well as leave comments and communicate with other users.
